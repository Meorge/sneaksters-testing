# Sneaksters
Sneaksters is a game about using teamwork to steal treasure! Players must take up one of two jobs - the Eyes and the Thieves. The Thieves' objective is to sneak though a labyrinth and collect Gemstones, but they don't have any idea what the layout of the map is. The Eyes, on the other hand, have an overhead view of the whole area, but no direct control over the Thieves' movements. The two groups must communicate in order to escape without getting busted.


## Download the Alpha

Note: Sneaksters is currently in alpha. There's likely to be a lot of bugs and issues, some of which may be game-breaking (although they should NOT pose any threat to your computer).

Please submit bug reports and suggestions at https://github.com/Meorge/sneaksters-testing/issues.

### What to include in a bug report
In order to help us diagnose the problem, please include:
- The operating system you played the game on when the bug occurred (Windows, macOS, or Linux)
- What you were doing when the bug occurred
- Screenshots of the bug (if it is visual)
- Player log files
  - Windows: `C:\Users\username\AppData\LocalLow\ZenithPoint\Sneaksters\Player.log`

### Note regarding suggestions
We'll try to look at every suggestion that comes in. It's possible that a suggestion may go against the spirit of the game as we see it or be too much work to implement, and as such we won't include it. Alternatively, we may already have plans to implement something before you suggest it! As such, there's no guarantee that suggestions will be included or attributed to you.

## FAQs
**Ahhh! The music is so loud!**

Sorry about that! You can turn the music and SFX volumes down in Settings -> Audio, from the main menu. Hopefully, in the future the volume will default to a lower level.


**The screen is too big for my monitor!**

You can adjust the screen resolution in Settings -> Resolution & Quality, from the main menu. We're hoping to add in "smart resolution" in the future, where the game will fit itself to your screen.
If you can't reach the Settings button due to the screen size, please let us know! That'll give us even more motivation to fix it.


**Will I get anything for playtesting?**

Since this is a public alpha, **we aren't planning on any monetary compensation for playtesters**. In fact, **no members of the Zenith Point team are expecting to receive any money from the project** - the hope is to use any money we make from Sneaksters to 1) keep servers maintained and 2) start putting money into a savings fund for future projects.

 Playtesters *may* get some benefits when the game comes out, like a free/discounted copy and/or exclusive extras.
