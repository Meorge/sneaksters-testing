# Sneaksters
Sneaksters is a game about using teamwork to steal treasure! Players must take up one of two jobs - the Eyes and the Thieves. The Thieves' objective is to sneak though a labyrinth and collect Gemstones, but they don't have any idea what the layout of the map is. The Eyes, on the other hand, have an overhead view of the whole area, but no direct control over the Thieves' movements. The two groups must communicate in order to escape without getting busted.

### Note regarding suggestions
