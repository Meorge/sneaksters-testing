# Sneaksters
Sneaksters is a game about using teamwork to steal treasure! Players must take up one of two jobs - the Eyes and the Thieves. The Thieves' objective is to sneak though a labyrinth and collect Gemstones, but they don't have any idea what the layout of the map is. The Eyes, on the other hand, have an overhead view of the whole area, but no direct control over the Thieves' movements. The two groups must communicate in order to escape without getting busted.


## Download the Pre-Alpha
You can find the latest builds of Sneaksters at https://github.com/Meorge/sneaksters-testing/releases.

Note: Sneaksters is currently in **pre-alpha**. There's likely to be a lot of bugs and issues, some of which may be game-breaking (although they should NOT pose any threat to your computer).


## Report Bugs and Suggestions
Please submit bug reports and suggestions at https://github.com/Meorge/sneaksters-testing/issues.

### What to include in a bug report
In order to help us diagnose the problem, please include:
- The operating system you played the game on when the bug occurred (Windows, macOS, or Linux)
- What you were doing when the bug occurred
- Screenshots of the bug (if it is visual)
- Player log files
  - Windows: `C:\Users\username\AppData\LocalLow\ZenithPoint\Sneaksters\Player.log`
  - macOS: `~/Library/Logs/Zenith Point/Sneaksters/Player.log`
  - Linux: `~/.config/unity3d/ZenithPoint/Sneaksters/Player.log`
  - Before you send a log file, you may want to skim through it and confirm that there is no personally identifying information (such as your name from a file path).

### Note regarding suggestions
We'll try to look at every suggestion that comes in. It's possible that a suggestion may go against the spirit of the game as we see it or be too much work to implement, and as such we won't include it. Alternatively, we may already have plans to implement something before you suggest it! As such, there's no guarantee that suggestions will be included or attributed to you.

## FAQs
**Gah! There are so many bugs!**

That's why it's a pre-alpha and not a finished game! The purpose of the pre-alpha is to crowd-source bug testing so that we can get the game running nicely as soon as possible. If you find any bugs, please report them as described above.

**Ahhh! The music is so loud!**

Sorry about that! You can turn the music and SFX volumes down in Settings -> Sounds & Audio, from the main menu.


**The game's window is too big for my monitor!**

You can adjust the screen resolution in Settings -> Resolution & Quality, from the main menu. The game _should_ resize itself upon first bootup in order to fit your monitor screen, so please let us know if it does not. 


**Will I get anything for playtesting?**

Since this is a public pre-alpha, **we aren't planning on any monetary compensation for playtesters**. In fact, **no members of the Zenith Point team are expecting to receive any money from the project** - the hope is to use any money we make from Sneaksters to 1) keep servers maintained and 2) start putting money into a savings fund for future projects.

 Playtesters *may* get some benefits when the game comes out, like a free/discounted copy and/or exclusive extras. By participating in the pre-alpha, your name will also be included in the credits under "External Playtesting". (If you would prefer to have your name _not_ be in the credits, just let us know.)
